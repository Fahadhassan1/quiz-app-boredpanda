## Reflection

This project provided a clear, engaging opportunity to demonstrate front-end fundamentals, including:

- DOM manipulation  
- Event handling  
- State management with `localStorage`  
- UX design best practices  

Edge cases like answer persistence, resume functionality, and real-time navigation logic made this task a rewarding frontend challenge.
